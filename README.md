# PyTorch CNN

In this project, I follow along with one of my favorite YouTubers Nicholas Renotte to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for an Image Classifier. Though I have used CNN's before, I have never built one, nor used one in PyTorch. I'm used to using TensorFlow for a lot of Neural Networks so I thought this follow along would help learn a interesting process that will expand my options in providing solutions.
